Walbaum Metafont
================

A digital version of Walbaum based on a scan of an original
specimensheet using metafont.  The goal of this font-program is to
demonstrate how parametric design can be used to digitize an existing
font.  It also shows how to create a family of typefaces from a single
source.

Compiling:
==========

You need metafont, gftodvi and dvips (they normal come with a
tex/mf distribution).

to create a specimen for a small font size (5pt)
   make walbaum-tiny.ps

to create a specimen for a large font size (17pt)   
   make walbaum-large.ps

LICENCE:
========

The code for this demo is put in the public domain.  A more complete version
maybe be available later under a more restrictive license.
